# Almost Done! Just Create the Repository

Your code is ready and committed locally! You just need to create the repository on GitHub.

## Quick Steps:

1. **A browser window should have opened** - if not, go to: https://github.com/new

2. **Repository settings:**
   - Repository name: `architmainlink` (should be pre-filled)
   - Description: (optional) "Trading profile website"
   - Choose: **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT check:
     - ❌ Add a README file
     - ❌ Add .gitignore
     - ❌ Choose a license
   - Leave all checkboxes UNCHECKED

3. **Click "Create repository"**

4. **After creating, come back here and I'll push your code!**

Or if you want to push manually, run:
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted:
- Username: `v3xxf`
- Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

### To create a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "Vercel Deployment"
4. Select scope: ✅ **repo** (full control)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use it as your password when Git asks

---

**Your repository will be:** https://github.com/v3xxf/architmainlink
