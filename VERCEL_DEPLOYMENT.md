# Deploy to Vercel - Final Step! 🚀

Your code is now on GitHub! Time to deploy it to Vercel.

## Quick Deployment Steps:

1. **A browser window should have opened** - if not, go to: https://vercel.com/new

2. **Sign in with GitHub:**
   - Click "Continue with GitHub"
   - Authorize Vercel to access your repositories

3. **Import your repository:**
   - Look for `v3xxf/architmainlink` in the list
   - Click "Import" next to it

4. **Configure project (usually auto-detected):**
   - Framework Preset: **Other** (or leave as auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: `./` (default)
   - Build Command: Leave empty (static site)
   - Output Directory: Leave empty (default)
   - Install Command: Leave empty

5. **Click "Deploy"**

6. **Wait for deployment** (usually 30-60 seconds)

7. **Your site will be live!** 🎉
   - Vercel will give you a URL like: `architmainlink.vercel.app`
   - You can also add a custom domain later

## What Happens Next:

- ✅ Vercel automatically deploys your site
- ✅ Every time you push to GitHub, Vercel will auto-deploy
- ✅ You get a free SSL certificate
- ✅ Global CDN for fast loading worldwide

## Your Links:

- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/v3xxf/architmainlink
- **Vercel Dashboard:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **Your Live Site:** (will be shown after deployment)

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
- Make sure you're signed in to Vercel with GitHub
- Check that the repository is visible in the import list
- Vercel should auto-detect it's a static site (no build needed)
